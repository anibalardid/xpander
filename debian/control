Description: Text expander for Linux written in python.
 You type an abbreviation and it's automatically expanded to a predefined block
 of text called a phrase. This is useful when filling out forms, coding
 and whenever else you need to write the same block of text over and over.
 Each phrase is stored as JSON file in a user configurable directory, default
 is ~/.phrases.
 Xpander features full support for multiple keyboard layouts (up to 4),
 filtering by window and token expansion:
 * $| marks where cursor will be placed after expansion;
 * $C is replaced by clipboard contents;
 You can also mark a phrase as a command. In this case phrase contents are
 interpreted as command line and it's output pasted instead.
 When putting tabs in phrase body and setting sending method as keyboard
 actual Tab keypresses are sent. This means you can fill several form fields in
 one go, simply by separating with tabs.
